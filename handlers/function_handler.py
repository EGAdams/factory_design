"""
Defines an abstract base class `FunctionHandler` that provides an interface for handling file-related functions.

The `FunctionHandler` class defines an abstract `execute` method that takes a dictionary of parameters and returns a string representing the result of executing the file-related function.

Subclasses of `FunctionHandler` must implement the `execute` method to provide the actual implementation of the file-related function.
